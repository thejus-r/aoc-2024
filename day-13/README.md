# --- Day 13: Claw Contraption ---

## Solution:

### For Part 1:

Did a simple brute force, as it metions 100 is the max

### For Part 2:

Learnt to obtimize from youtube, by solving the two equations.
From equation

`(Ax _ S) + (Bx _ T) = Px and (Ay _ S) + (By _ T) = Py -> This will have unique solution
we can solve S = (Px _ By - Py _ Bx) / (Ax _ By - Ay _ Bx) and T = (Px - Ax \* S) / Bx 
`
